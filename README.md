US Spending Behaviors of Discretionary Income
=============================================

Project Description
-------------------

Our goal is to identify insights into consumer discretionary spending habits by
different demographic factors using pandas and matplotlib. All our data is from
the [Consumer Expenditure Surveys](https://www.bls.gov/cex/home.htm) published
by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

In a time of financial struggles facing the US during the time of a pandemic, we
were inspired to analyzed consumer spending of their extra money, that is their
discretionary money, over the years. We're curious to uncover spending patterns
from the past two decades to speculate on the consumer behavioral changes that
might be occuring now. Specifically, we sought insights through the following
questions:

1.  What are the overall average spending of discretionary income?

2.  Looking at trends from the 2008 economic recessions, how might consumers
    expenditure adjust in recovering from the coronavirus shut downs?

    -   Compute the annual percent change in expenditure in 2009

3.  What affect does demographics have on discretionary spending?

    -   Age of reference person

    -   Race

    -   Gender

    -   Highest education level

    -   Region of residence

    -   Income class

4.  Are there any trends that should be further analyzed from the above
    analysis?
